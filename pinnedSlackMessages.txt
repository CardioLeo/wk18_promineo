Hi all!
My name is Kristina. I will be your mentor and your main point of contact for any curriculum questions you may have during the next 18 weeks. You are also free to book a mentor session with any of our mentors, based on preference and scheduling needs.
A little bit about me: I graduated from the Front End Bootcamp in October 2021. Outside of coding, I love camping, board games, video games and making music.


Learning software development can be challenging, so asking questions regularly is highly encouraged! I can be reached via email and Slack (preferred). You may also post questions in your cohort-specific channel and Slack General. In addition, office hours are a great resource for help and extra practice.
It is also highly encouraged that you get to know your peers. We have seen a lot of success when students create study groups!
If youâ€™d like to setup a 30-minute meeting with me, here is my calendar:
