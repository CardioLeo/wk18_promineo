# Description: A place for my last class notes for Promineo Tech's Front End Bootcamp

---

Don't worry about the number of people who have applied, or when it was uploaded.

projects, no need for a portfolio if you don't have multiple projects; [different for ]

hunter.cl --> website, spreadsheet layouts, collumns, for job descriptions and stuff. accepted, rejected, helps keep track of all your job applications. This is such a great idea!

another website that helps you filter out interview questions for the job which you're looking for: bigfrontend.dev

Some tests

1.
72 hours to finish, git commits, when you committed, etc.
take home test/project
Small increments!!!
Descriptive Commit Messages...

2.
timed in person exercises within 1-2 hours
3.
live coding in front of someone else

there will be an initial interview that covers basic personal stuff, but a second or third one will be about technical skills

bigger companies will have more interviews. smaller, less.

if they have big long 4+ hour interviews or screening, you can ask if it can be split up. [1 hour round x 4?]

How do you practice for the coding part?

resources, free code camp, etc. stuff like that. free stuff.

Suggested course through resources, suggested by Stepanski.

FreeCodeCamp --> [????] --> hackerRank --> leetCode

book... pdf?

all of this info is in a pinned message somewhere...

Redux, Deployment.

engineers... looking at resumes, quick looks and sustained looks. this is what people do. maybe 10 seconds.


use bootstrap rather than redux? I can't concentrate. the baby is going to sleep, supposedly, in the room I usually have class. Adalee is watching Gilmore Girls. Juniper won't stop touching the computer. It's... frustrating and stressful as a last day of class.

class ended.

ending message: Honestly, I'm really disappointed in what all happened in October. So many life events took place and I just couldn't keep up. I'm excited to finish the course material, though. I really appreciated the opportunity, the resources and connections. :)
